# Baby's first clj(s) project

Welcome to my first Clojure/ClojureSript project!

This was made during a [ClojureBridge London](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/) workshop, with help from a great coach (:wave: Oskar).

## The app

This will hopefully grow to be an app for people to quickly find out if they need to wear more or less clothes than yesterday... :grimacing:

So far it's only using ClojureScript, but I'm hoping to do some server-side stuff with Clojure soon - since we are kinda blocked by CORS.
